# DataReplicationProject
The three files you will need to follow along with the Quarto document in order of use in the code chunks are as follows:
1. Species List for Phylogenetic Tree.csv
2. Summary Statistics for Fruit Species.csv
3. Ethanol and Seed Dispersal Syndrome.csv
These are all located in the repository for ease of access. Some are also loaded in as .xlsx, but the coding uses the .csv format for ease of importing the url directly without requiring downloading the files onto your local computer.

The figures/data being replicated are Figure 1 and Table 1.
Both .jpeg documents of the figure and table have been uploaded into this repository, but will appear within the Quarto when rendered as an HTML.
